# void-installer

The next-generation Void Linux installer, replacing the venerable "el-cheapo" installer.

## Goals

- **Extensible**: designed to be extended from the start, with as many generic components as possible
- **Flexible**: works with interactive and non-interactive interfaces
- **User-Friendly**: easy-to-use and accessible
